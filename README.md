```

#### Preparing db

* `rake db:migrate`

#### Generating config
* create config/trustlink.yml
```yml
key: _YOUR_TRUSTLINK_HASH_
domain: example.com

```

#### Inserting links
Simply put helper call in desired place. Like this:
```ruby
<%= trustlink_links -%>
```

#### Fetching links
* `rake trustlink:fetch`

Run it by cron or use whenever gem or something other way you like.

#### Customizing templates (optional)
* `rails g trustlink:views`

Templates will be copied to views/trustlink folder.

### Notes
* In _link.html.erb first and last string inserting trustlink code recognized by trustlink bots. It should not be removed. Also important to levae url untouched.
* By default no style included. You can use styles extracted from trustlink's template. Just replace class to 'ads' used by default or use your own.
* Multi-domain feature currently not supported. Ask if you need this feature.
